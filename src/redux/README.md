 ## redux
 
 1. Holds the state for a component that can be changed by action for any other components   
 2. Provides a grouping for managing properties(state) at a single location
 3. Simply put, a reducer takes the initial state and directive(action) and returns the result
   of applying the directive(action) on the old state
